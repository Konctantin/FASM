; The following structure resides at the beginning of memory block provided
; to the fasm_Assemble function. The condition field contains the same value
; as the one returned by function.
;   When function returns FASM_OK condition, the output_length and
; output_data fields are filled - with pointer to generated output
; (somewhere within the provided memory block) and the count of bytes stored
; there.
;   When function returns FASM_ERROR, the error_code is filled with the
; code of specific error that happened and error_line is a pointer to the
; LINE_HEADER structure, providing information about the line that caused
; the error.

; The following structure has two variants - it either defines the line
; that was loaded directly from source, or the line that was generated by
; macroinstruction. First case has the highest bit of line_number set to 0,
; while the second case has this bit set.
;   In the first case, the file_path field contains pointer to the path of
; source file (empty string if it's the source that was provided directly to
; fasm_Assemble function), the line_number is the number of line within
; that file (starting from 1) and the file_offset field contains the offset
; within the file where the line starts.
;   In the second case the macro_calling_line field contains the pointer to
; LINE_HEADER structure for the line which called the macroinstruction, and
; the macro_line field contains the pointer to LINE_HEADER structure for the
; line within the definition of macroinstruction, which generated this one.
